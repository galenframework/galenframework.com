    About
==================================================
"Galen Framework":http://galenframework.com is a test framework which was originally introduced for testing layout of web-applications in a real browser. Nowadays it became a fully functional testing framework with rich reporting and test management system. It supports both JavaScript and Java tests.

Galen Framework was made with responsive design in mind. It works in a following way:
# Galen opens a page in browser
# Resizes browser to specified size
# Tests the layout with Galen Specs

In case the page is not directly accessible Galen Framework allows you to perform some operations on the website first. As it is based on Selenium you are free to do whatever you need like: clicking, typing, injecting client-side javascript etc.

"Galen Specs":/docs/reference-galen-spec-language-guide/ is the language with which you define how the page should look like for different devices. The language is quite advanced and allows you to express complete layout of your website with minimal text. Take a look at the following example.

$$ galen-specs

= Main section =
    @on *
        header:
            height 100px
            inside screen 0px top
            width 100% of screen/width

        menu:
            height 50 to 60px
            width 100% of screen/width
            below header ~ 0px

        search-button:
            inside menu 20 to 50px left, 0 to 10px top

    @on mobile
        search-button:
            width 100px
        
    @on desktop 
        search-button:
            width 150px 
            
$$


Galen uses "Selenium":http://www.seleniumhq.org/ for interacting with elements on page and getting their locations and dimensions. 
Once Galen sees that something is wrong - it reports the error, makes a screenshot and highlights the misbehaving element on it.
You can also run test against "Selenium Grid":http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2 in case you want to cover cross-browser layout testing.

In case you don't have resources to set up a Selenium Grid you can also run Galen tests with "Experitest":https://experitest.com/, "Sauce Labs":https://saucelabs.com/ or "BrowserStack":http://www.browserstack.com. Actually with Experitest, BrowserStack and Sauce Labs you can even run your tests against real mobile devices like iPhone or Android so you don't need to emulate the mobile layout by resizing a browser.

Galen offers two ways of reporting:
- *Html Reports* - gives nice overview of all test suites with complete reports, screenshots and highlighted errors
- *TestNG Reports* - can be used for embedding Galen in a CI tool like "Jenkins":http://jenkins-ci.org/
