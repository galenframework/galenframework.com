================================

To give more flexibility and maintanability to user Galen came up with another simple format for defining test suites. Test suites are just a set of pages that needs to be checked with a propriate test specs. But there is something more in there which gives a lot of power in testing.

* "Basic Format":#BasicFormat
* "Variables":#Variables
* "Browser Factory":#BrowserFactory
** "Defining a local browser":#Definingalocalbrowser
** "Running in Selenium Grid":#RunninginSeleniumGrid
** "JavaScript Browser Factory":#JavaScriptBrowserFactory

* "Test Groups":#TestGroups
* "Waiting for dynamic content":#Waitingfordynamiccontent
* "Page Dump":#PageDump

h1. Basic Format

Same way as in specs language the indentation is done with 1 to 8 spaces and all tabs are ignored. A test starts with a name and then you define the page and page actions

$$ galen-suites
Home page on a small mobile device
    http://example.com/home     320x600
        check   homepage.spec --include "mobile,all" --exclude "nomobile"
$$

In the example above we have defined the simplest test named *_"Home page on a small mobile device"_*. For this test we also specified that we want to run it against *_http://example.com/home_* with browser resized to 320x600. Then we defined the so called *Page Action* in which it is specified to use @homepage.spec@ file and also it says which tags to use and which ones to exclude.

This is how the two tests in a same suite would look like:

$$ galen-suites
Home page on a small mobile device
    http://example.com/home     320x600
        check   homepage.spec --include "mobile,all" --exclude "nomobile"

Login page on a small mobile device
    http://example.com/login 320x600
        check   login.spec --include "mobile,all" --exclude "nomobile"
$$


h1. Variables

It is always nice to put commonly used data in variables. e.g. we can put domain name in the variable. This can be done with special instruction: *set*

$$ galen-suites
@@ set domain example.com

Home page on a small mobile device
    http://${domain}/home     320x600
        check   homepage.spec --include "mobile,all" --exclude "nomobile"
$$

You can also define multiple variables within same instruction like this:

$$ galen-suites
@@ set 
    domain          example.com
    mobile_size     320x600

Home page on a small mobile device
    http://${domain}/home     ${mobile_size}
        check   homepage.spec --include "mobile,all" --exclude "nomobile"
$$

Or you can also use varible reference when defining another variable:

$$ galen-suites
@@ set 
    domain          example.com
    base_url        http://${domain}/

Home page on a small mobile device
    ${base_url} 320x600
        check   homepage.spec --include "mobile,all" --exclude "nomobile"
$$


h1. Browser Factory

There few ways you could run Galen. You can run tests in a specific browser (Firefox, Chrome, IE) or you can run tests against Selenium Grid.

h2. Defining a local browser

$$ galen-suites
Homepage in local Firefox browser
    selenium firefox http://example.com/  640x480
        check homepage.spec

Homepage in local Chrome browser
    selenium chrome http://example.com/  640x480
        check homepage.spec

Homepage in local Internet Explorer browser
    selenium ie http://example.com/  640x480
        check homepage.spec

Homepage in PhantomJS browser
    selenium phantomjs http://example.com/ 640x480
        check homepage.spec
$$

Actually if you skip the browser name before url Galen will pick Firefox by default. 


h2. Running in Selenium Grid

If you want to run Galen tests in parallel or if you want to maintain cross-browser testing then it is a good idea to configure a Selenium Grid _(follow this "tutorial":http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2 for setting up a Selenium Grid)_. In your Galen tests you can use it like this

$$ galen-suites
Homepage in Selenium Grid in Chrome
    selenium grid http://your.selenium.grid.hostname:4444/wd/hub --page http://example.com --size 640x480 --browser Chrome --version "21.0" --platform "XP"
        check homepage.spec
$$

The following are the arguments that you can use for selenium grid config:
* *browser* _- name of a browser which you can set in your Selenium Grid_
* *version* _-version a browser_
* *platform* _-name of operating system_
* *page* _- the url to your test website_
* *size* _- the size of the browser window to which it should be resized_
* *dc.* _- the desired capability prefix. Every argument that starts with @dc.@ will be taken as desired capability for grid node_

Actually the *browser*, *version* and *platform* are optional arguments so you can use it like this:

$$ galen-suites
Homepage in Selenium Grid 
    selenium grid http://your.selenium.grid.hostname:4444/wd/hub --page http://example.com --size 640x480 
        check homepage.spec
$$

Or it would be even better to put selenium grid in the variable:

$$ galen-suites
@@ Set 
    run_in_grid    selenium grid http://your.selenium.grid.hostname:4444/wd/hub 

Homepage in Selenium Grid 
    ${run_in_grid} --page http://example.com --size 640x480 
        check homepage.spec
$$


And here is an example of using desired capabilities

$$ galen-suites
Homepage in Selenium Grid
    selenium grid http://localhost:4444/wd/hub --dc.browser android --dc.device-orientation landscape
$$


h2. JavaScript Browser Factory

In case you would like to take full control over instantiation of WebDriver you can use the so called @jsfactory@. It delegates the creation of browser to a user-defined script. This might be very handy in case you need to provide some additional settings in a profile. Lets image you need to open browser with specific language settings. Here is an example of a script @mydriver.js@ that does that:

$$ javascript
importClass(org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver);
importClass(org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxProfile);
importClass(net.mindengine.galen.utils.GalenUtils);
importClass(net.mindengine.galen.browser.SeleniumBrowser);

var pageUrl = args[0];
var size = GalenUtils.readSize(args[1]);

var profile = new FirefoxProfile();
profile.setPreference("intl.accept_languages", "no,en-us,en");

var browser = new SeleniumBrowser(new FirefoxDriver(profile));
browser.load(pageUrl);
browser.changeWindowSize(size);

browser;
$$

And here is an example how to use this script @mydriver.js@ in the test suite:

$$ galen-suites
Home page on a mobile device
    jsfactory mydriver.js http://samples.galenframework.com/tutorial1/tutorial1.html  400x480
        check homepage.spec --include "mobile"
$$

You should always provide a script for @jsfactory@. All other arguments will be copied to the @args@ array in the script. As you see from example above the argument @http://samples.galenframework.com/tutorial1/tutorial1.html@ is stored at 0 position in @args@ array and argument @640x480@ is at 1 position

bq. *IMPORTANT!* If you use @jsfactory@ you also have to handle opening of a url and resizing browser window. In this browser factory Galen is not doing anything so you have to manage this by yourself. Just take a look how it is implemented in the example above

In case you don't want to implement browser window resize and loading of page url you can use page actions @open@ and @resize@ for @jsfactory@ based tests.

$$ galen-suites
Home page test
    jsfactory firefox.js
        open http://example.com
        resize 640x480
        check homepage.spec
$$

h2. Replacing page url in reports

Once the test is done Galen will generate html report and in it it will use the browser factory that you defined in your spec. If you would like to change the way it appears there you can use '|' symbol like in the following example

$$ galen-suites
Login page test
    Login page url /login  | http://example.com/login   640x480
        check login.spec
$$

In the end galen will use everything before '|' in html report. So only the @Login page url /login@ part will be shown. 

h1. Page Actions

h2. Page Actions: Cookies Handling

Sometimes you need to work with functionality that is hidden behind "Feature switch (or Feature Toggle)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle. That is now possible with Galen Framework. Lets imagine that for your website you use the cookie @MyFeature1=allowed; path=/@ to set a feature switch. Now you need to test that functionality behind the feature switch. You could do it like this. 

$$ galen-suites
Homepage on mobile device
    http://example.com/   400x600
        cookie "MyFeature1=allowed; path=/"
        check homepage.spec --include "all,mobile"
$$

What will happen is that Galen will generate a javascript for setting a new cookie and will inject it in browser. After that it will refresh the browser window so that you can test your page properly.

h2. Page Actions: JavaScript Injection

Sometimes you need to test things that are not easy accessible. For example user profile page. Normally you need to authorize first. Or another example: there could be a hidden menu that pops up only in case you interact with something on a page. For both problems there two different solutions: *javascript injection* and *selenium interaction*

You can inject your own javascript with wich you can change your page. For that you need to save a javascript in a separate file e.g. @open-popup.js@:


$$ javascript
 $("popup").show();
$$

Then you should trigger this javascript injection from your Galen tests like this:

$$ galen-suites
Popup on Home Page
    http://example.com/ 640x480
        inject open-popup.js
        check homepage-popup.spec
$$


h2. Page Actions: Selenium Interaction

Another thing that you might need sometimes - is doing something on website before testing with Galen Specs. Lets say you need to login to get to your profile. Galen allows you to run javascript in which you can take over the browser using WebDriver.

bq. *IMPORTANT!* Even though this page action also uses javascript please note its not getting injected in your webpage. It is actually being executed separately and in it you can operate with your browser: click the elements, type text to textfields and even change the size of a window.


The content of some login flow in file @login.js@

$$ javascript

// These two values are passed from Galen test
var userLogin = arg.login;
var userPassword = arg.password

// Here we type user login and password on our login page
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#login-form .login")).sendKeys(userLogin);
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#login-form .password")).sendKeys(userPassword);

// Submitting the login page
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#login-form .submit")).click();

// Waiting till user profile page is shown 
function pageIsLoaded() {
    return driver.findElement(By.id("user-profile")) != null;
}


waitFor(pageIsLoaded);

function waitFor(func) {
    var timeout = 10;

    while(timeout > 0 && !func()) {
        timeout = timeout - 1;
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    }

    if (!func()) {
        throw new Exception("Wait timeout");
    }
}
$$

Once we are finished with the @login.js@ lets call it before we can test user profile page with @userprofile.spec@ file

$$ galen-suites
User profile page
    http://example.com/login 640x480
        run login.js '{login: "user@example.com", password: "qwerty"}'
        check userprofile.spec
$$


h2. Page Actions: Open and Resize 

In case you use your own factory for creating a browser and you don't want to handle url openin in there you can use @open@ page action

$$ galen-suites
Home page test
    jsfactory firefox.js
        open http://example.com
        check homepage.spec
$$

You can also use @resize@ page action for changing browser window size

$$ galen-suites
Home page test
    jsfactory firefox.js
        open http://example.com
        resize 640x480
        check homepage.spec
$$



h1. Parameterization

Once you start thinking on testing the responsive design for your web application you might need to look into parameterization. For instance you want to run tests against different devices or different browsers. This can be done by writing a data table and marking the test with "*parameterized*" special instruction

$$ galen-suites
@@ parameterized
    | deviceName | tags      | size     |
    | Mobile     | mobile    | 320x600  |
    | Tablet     | tablet    | 640x480  |
    | Desktop    | desktop   | 1024x800 |
Home page on ${deviceName} device
    http://example.com/ ${size}
        check homepage.spec --include "${tags}"
$$

As you see we defined a data table where the first row is used as a header with names of parameters. Using the example above Galen will run test 3 times with all listed parameters. In the report you will see the tests runs like this:
* Home page on Mobile device
* Home page on Tablet device
* Home page on Desktop device

But what if we want to parameterize the parameterized? What could that mean? Lets say you would like to run tests in all browsers and with all different sizes. This can also be done in the following way:

$$ galen-suites
@@ parameterized
    | browser  |
    | firefox  |
    | chrome   |
    | ie       |
@@ parameterized
    | deviceName | tags      | size     |
    | Mobile     | mobile    | 320x600  |
    | Tablet     | tablet    | 640x480  |
    | Desktop    | desktop   | 1024x800 |
Home page on ${deviceName} device in ${browser} browser
    ${browser} http://example.com/ ${size}
        check homepage.spec --include "${tags}"
$$

The example above would give us 9 runs for the same test. The resulting report would give these test runs:
* Home page on Mobile device in firefox browser
* Home page on Tablet device in firefox browser
* Home page on Desktop device in firefox browser
* Home page on Mobile device in chrome browser
* Home page on Tablet device in chrome browser
* Home page on Desktop device in chrome browser
* Home page on Mobile device in ie browser
* Home page on Tablet device in ie browser
* Home page on Desktop device in ie browser

 *IMPORTANT!* Keep in mind to pass Chrome Driver URL during test execution:
 
 $$ bash
 galen test <TESTFILE> -DwebsiteUrl=<URL> --htmlreport <REPORT_DIR> -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=<PATH_TO_CHROMEDRIVER>
 $$

h1. Tables

Of course the parameterizations are nice but what if we are using 30 tests and we want to parameterize all of them? In this case we can share the data tables and reuse them in our parameterized tests.  Take a look at the example below

$$ galen-suites
@@ table devices
    | deviceName | tags      | size     |
    | Mobile     | mobile    | 320x600  |
    | Tablet     | tablet    | 640x480  |
    | Desktop    | desktop   | 1024x800 |

@@ parameterized using devices
Home page on ${deviceName} device
    http://example.com/ ${size}
        check homepage.spec --include "${tags}"

@@ parameterized using devices
Login page on ${deviceName} device
    http://example.com/login ${size}
        check login.spec --include "${tags}"
$$

You can also merge tables inside parameterization block like this

$$ galen-suites
@@ table deviceList_A
    | deviceName | tags      | size     |
    | Mobile     | mobile    | 320x600  |

@@ parameterized using deviceList_A, deviceList_B
Login page on ${deviceName} device
    http://example.com/login ${size}
        check login.spec --include "${tags}"
$$


h1. Disabling Tests

In case you want to temporarely disable a test just put the @disabled@ special instruction before it.

$$ galen-suites
@@ disabled
Home page 
    http://example.com      640x480
        check homepage.spec

Login page 
    http://example.com/login      640x480
        check homepage.spec
$$


h1. Test Groups

Since version 1.6 you can tag your tests with groups. That will allow you to group your tests in Html report and choose which group to run in command line. To mark a specific test as a group just use @groups@ keyword:

$$ galen-suites
@@ groups mobile, homepage, temp
Home page test
    http://example.com 1024x768
        check homepage.spec
$$


h1. Waiting for dynamic content

Sometimes you need to test a page that is generated dynamically and you have to wait until it is properly rendered before checking its layout. Since version 0.10.0 Galen offers a @wait@ action. It can be used in two ways:
* Strict timeout
* Condition based timeout

h3. Strict timeout

You can define timeout in milliseconds (ms), seconds (s) or minutes (m)

$$ galen-suites
Home page test
    http://example.com 640x480
        wait 10s
        check homepage.spec
$$


h3. Condition based timeout

For this way of waiting you need to provide a locator (css, xpath or id) for an element and a condition for it. There 4 conditions that could be used in @wait@ action:
* element appears in DOM
* element is removed from DOM
* element becomes visible
* element gets hidden

In case the condition fails Galen will throw an exception and interrupt the test.

Example of waiting for element to appear in DOM:

$$ galen-suites
Home page test
    http://example.com 640x480
        wait 1m until exist "css: div.list a"
        check homepage.spec
$$


Example of waiting for element to be removed from DOM:

$$ galen-suites
Home page test
    http://example.com 640x480
        wait 1m until gone "xpath: //div[@class='list']//a"
        check homepage.spec
$$


Example of waiting for element to become visible:

$$ galen-suites
Home page test
    http://example.com 640x480
        wait 1m until visible "id: login-box"
        check homepage.spec
$$


Example of waiting for element to become hidden:

$$ galen-suites
Home page test
    http://example.com 640x480
        wait 1m until hidden "id: login-box"
        check homepage.spec
$$

You can also mix multiple conditions with multiple elements like this:

$$ galen-suites
Home page test
    http://example.com 640x480
        wait 1m until exist "id: login-box" "css: div.list"  gone "css: #logout"  visible "css: a.signup"
        check homepage.spec
$$


h1. Page Dump

Since version 1.3 Galen has a feature of creating a page dump. With a page dump you can store information about all your test objects on the page together with image samples.


$$ galen-suites
Home page test
    http://example.com 640x480
        dump homepage.spec --name "Home page" --export dumps/homepage --max-width 200 --max-height 200
